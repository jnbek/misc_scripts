This is a collection of Mostly Shell and a few Perl scripts I've acquired/written over the years.

backup_db.sh:    A MySQL utility that repairs/optimizes and creates a 30 day archive of backups for all MySQL databases on a given system.
dos2unix:        A 'should-be' binary safe dos2unix clone written in perl.
installworld.sh: Part of the old school FreeBSD upgrade process, the install portion.
m4a2mp3:         Converts AAC files to mp3. For back in the day when few Linux players supported AAC. (Like.. 2002??)
makeworld.sh:    Part of the old school FreeBSD upgrade process, the build portion. Does Kernel Rebuild and Install as well.
start-weechat:   A small tmux wrapper to either start a tmux session and start weechat inside, or connect to an existing session.
tcpmon.sh:       Just a one liner, I can never remember the command syntax to view like connections on pflog0.

========== NOTICE ==========

I am releasing these scripts to the public as public domain, unless otherwise noted within the files themselves.
